## Notes
Currently, the backend is not necessary for deployment or usage of the app. There is already a custom API proxy server using AWS Lambda
and API Gateway to handle API requests to the Riot Games API from the app's frontend. In Future updates it is possible that
this app will require a backend to handle calls to a (future) database which will store/update user statistics.
